# Vulkan-Helper
A very simple, header-only collection of functions to assist in vulkan development. 
Based off functions in the Vulkan Tutorial.
Functionality includes: Listing device and instance extensions, finding device and instance extensions, rating physical device suitablity, checking validation layers,
reading from a file, and creating shader modules.

To enable the checkVkResult() function, then do #define CHECKVKRESULT before including the file
